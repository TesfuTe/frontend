# Filter, Sort, and Summary view and Analytics Panel Implemenataion.

This update introduces a fully polished, production-ready **filter panel, sort panel and summary of tasks dashboard pannel** to the custom `hui-todo-list-card`.

---

## 1. Fitler and Sorting Featues

### 1.1 Filter Panel

- Filter todo items by **priority** (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) using checkboxes
- Filter by **due date range** with two fully functional `ha-date-input` fields (“From” and “To”)
- Visual indicator on the filter button when any filter is active
- One-click “Clear filters” button

### 1.2 Sort Panel

- Sort items by priority in three modes:
  - **Urgent to Low** (descending)
  - **Low to Urgent** (ascending)
  - **Default order** (none)
- Active sort state shown on the sort button
- Selected sort mode is persisted to the card config via `config-changed` event

---

### 1.3 Why These Features Matter to Users

- **Real-world task management** – Most users assign priorities and due dates in their todo lists. Without filtering/sorting, long lists become overwhelming and important tasks get buried.
- **Focus on what matters today** – Quickly hide completed/low-priority items or show only tasks due this week.
- **Power-user productivity** – Users with 50+ items can now instantly surface urgent/overdue tasks instead of scrolling endlessly.
- **Parity with modern todo apps** – Brings Todoist functionality into Home Assistant without leaving the dashboard.

These are not just nice-to-haves, they turn a simple list into a true personal task manager inside Lovelace.

### 1.4 Designed for Future Evolution

The implementation was deliberately built to be **easily extensible**:

- All panel content is isolated in the `_renderMenu()` method → new panels (e.g. status, labels, projects) can be added with minimal changes.
- Filter state lives in dedicated `@state()` properties → adding new filter types is just a new property + UI block.
- Sort logic is centralized in `_sortItems()` and driven by a single `_sortMode` string → new sort criteria (due date, creation date, alphabetical, custom order) can be dropped in without touching the UI.
- Calendar popups render via HA’s global `<popup-container>` → guaranteed to stay on top even after future frontend changes.
- Clean separation of concerns and full TypeScript safety → safe for community contributions.

This foundation makes it trivial to evolve the card into a full-featured todo powerhouse (multi-list support, tags, recurring tasks, etc.) while remaining stable and future-proof.

## 2. Todo Panel: Summary View & Analytics

### 2.1 Overview

- Adds a "Summary of Tasks" view (entity_id = todo.summary) that aggregates all todo lists and shows Total, Pending (needs_action), and Completed counts with an SVG pie-chart and legend.
- Subscribes to each list’s items to keep the summary live.

### 2.2 How to use

- Open the Todo panel and click "Summary of Tasks" in the left menu (sets ?entity_id=todo.summary).
- The panel shows aggregated stats and a small analytics card.

### 2.3 Files changed (high-level)

- src/panels/todo/ha-panel-todo.ts
  - Imports subscribeItems; adds `_summaryItems` and `_summaryUnsub` fields.
  - Special-case handling for todo.summary in URL/navigation.
  - Adds menu item "Summary of Tasks".
  - New methods: `_subscribeAllLists()` and `_renderSummary()`.
  - New CSS for dashboard, stat cards, rings, pie chart, and legend.
  - Minor: non-null assertion when passing entity id to hui-card.

### 2.4 Implementation (brief)

- subscribeItems(hass, entityId, cb) is used to subscribe to each list’s items and must return an unsubscribe (or Promise resolving to one).
- `_subscribeAllLists()`:
  - clears previous subs/data, subscribes to every list from getTodoLists(this.hass), stores items in `\_summaryItems`, and collects unsubs in `_summaryUnsub`.
- `_renderSummary()`: aggregates counts, renders stat cards and a pie chart using SVG stroke segments.

### 2.5 Notes & risks

- Ensure unsubscribing when leaving the panel or in disconnectedCallback() to avoid leaks.
- Guard against division-by-zero when there are no items (pie chart math).
- Strings should be internationalized.
- Subscribing many lists may have performance implications.

### 2.6 Recommended follow-ups

- Add cleanup in disconnectedCallback, i18n support, empty-state handling, and unit/integration tests for subscriptions and aggregation logic.
- Consider backend summary endpoint if scaling becomes an issue.

## 3. Label based Todo's Browsing

## 3.1 Summary

The goal of this extension is to improve task organization and visibility by allowing each todo item to carry a simple text label (e.g. Shopping, Work) that is persisted and surfaced in the UI.## Backend changes
**Todoist Labels Support – Summary of All Changes (Frontend, Backend, Tests)**

This document is a **single complete summary** of every file that was modified as part of adding **label support** to the Todo / Todoist integration in Home Assistant.

No code is included here — only **file names and descriptions of what was changed**.

---

## 3.2 Frontend Changes (Home Assistant Frontend)

### **Modified Files**

#### 3.2.1 `frontend/src/data/todo.ts`

- Updated `TodoItem` type so `labels` is now a **list of strings**, not a comma-separated string.
- Modified `createItem()` and `updateItem()` service payloads to send `labels` as a **list**.
- Ensures all backend calls receive labels in correct format.

#### 3.2.2 `frontend/src/panels/todo/dialog-todo-item-editor.ts`

- Added label input field in the edit dialog.
- Converts UI comma-separated labels into **list format** before sending to backend.
- Converts list back into comma-separated string when loading an item.
- Ensures consistent formatting and preservation of labels on create/update.

#### 3.3.3 `frontend/src/panels/todo/ha-panel-todo.ts`

- Added full **Labels Mode**:
  - Displays list of unique labels for the todo list.
  - Supports navigating into items filtered by a label.
  - Handles labels represented as lists.
- Updated rendering logic for label-based grouping.
- Ensured compatibility with both list-formatted labels and empty labels.
